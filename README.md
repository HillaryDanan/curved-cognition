# Curved Cognition

Testing the geometric mismatch between biological cognition (curves, spirals, cycles) and artificial intelligence architectures (rectangular matrices).

## Core Hypothesis

Biological minds operate in curved geometries - neural dendrites branch fractally, memories reconsolidate in spirals, emotions orbit and return transformed. Yet we model intelligence using rectangular attention matrices and linear position encodings. This fundamental geometric mismatch may explain specific limitations in current AI systems' ability to understand temporal recursion, cyclical causality, and embodied reasoning.

## Research Questions

1. Do language models show systematic degradation when processing spiral/recursive temporal patterns?
2. Can models distinguish cyclical causation from linear sequences?
3. Do different architectures (GPT, Claude, Gemini, BERT) show different geometric biases?
4. Can geometric priming improve performance on curved reasoning tasks?

## Key Findings (In Progress)

- Baseline experiments establishing linear reasoning performance across models
- Spiral temporal degradation tests showing performance decline with recursive depth
- Orbital return pattern recognition comparing "same-but-different" understanding
- Fractal nesting tests for scale-invariant pattern recognition
