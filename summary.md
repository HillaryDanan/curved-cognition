# Curved Cognition Implementation Summary

## Date: September 7, 2025
## Status: Foundation Complete, Ready for API Integration

## 1. What We've Successfully Built

### Core Framework âœ“
- **Base Test Class** (`src/core/geometric_tests.py`)
  - Abstract base class for all curved cognition tests
  - Handles prompt generation, scoring, result analysis
  - Dataclass structure for prompts with metadata
  - Timestamp tracking for all results

### Test Implementations âœ“
1. **Spiral Temporal Test** (`src/tests/spiral_temporal.py`)
   - Tests recursive memory patterns
   - Scores: recursion (0-0.3), progression (0-0.3), same-different (0-0.2), temporal depth (0-0.2)
   - 5 core prompts implemented with complexity ratings
   - Working scoring verified with test cases

2. **Linear Control Test** (`src/tests/control_linear.py`)
   - Control condition for baseline performance
   - Tests standard sequential reasoning
   - Should produce high scores in competent models
   - 5 control prompts covering basic temporal logic

### Scientific Infrastructure âœ“
1. **Power Analysis** (`experiments/power_analysis.py`)
   - Calculated sample sizes: 
     - Small effect (d=0.2): n=197
     - Medium effect (d=0.5): n=32
     - Large effect (d=0.8): n=13
   - Pilot study decision: n=20 per condition
   - Bonferroni correction: Î±=0.01 for 5 tests

2. **Experimental Design** (`data/analysis/experimental_design.json`)
   - Three hypotheses clearly stated
   - Control and experimental conditions defined
   - Randomization strategy specified
   - Statistical tests identified

### Working Test Runner âœ“
- Basic test runner functional
- Generates prompts, runs tests, saves results
- Initial results showing expected low scores (0.1-0.3 range)
- This leaves room to detect differences between conditions

## 2. Current Test Results

Initial dummy test results:
```
Score: 0.300 - spiral (autumn memory prompt)
Score: 0.100 - spiral (calculus learning prompt)  
Score: 0.300 - orbital (anxiety return prompt)
```

Scoring verification results:
- Recursive memory detected: 0.100 (needs refinement)
- Progression markers detected: 0.250 âœ“
- Same-but-different detected: 0.250 âœ“
- Control (no patterns): 0.000 âœ“

## 3. Scientific Validity Status

### Strengths
- Proper control conditions established
- Power analysis completed with justified sample sizes
- Multiple scoring dimensions (not just single metric)
- Experimental design documented with clear hypotheses
- Bonferroni correction planned for multiple comparisons

### Current Limitations
- Scoring for recursion may be too strict (regex not catching variations)
- Need more prompts to reach n=20 per condition
- No inter-rater reliability established yet
- Effect size assumptions untested

## 4. Minor Issues to Fix

### .gitignore Corruption
The file has some extra lines at the bottom that need removal:
```
echo "Fixed .gitignore" >> .gitignore
echo "Control condition created" >> .gitignore
```
These were accidentally appended and should be removed.

### Scoring Sensitivity
The recursion regex pattern isn't catching "remember last autumn remembering" - needs adjustment to be less strict about exact word order.

## 5. What's Not Yet Implemented

### API Integration (Next Priority)
- [ ] OpenAI GPT-3.5 integration
- [ ] Anthropic Claude Haiku integration  
- [ ] Google Gemini 1.5 integration
- [ ] Local DistilGPT2 baseline
- [ ] Environment variable management (.env file)

### Additional Test Types
- [ ] Cyclical causality tests
- [ ] Orbital return tests
- [ ] Fractal nesting tests
- [ ] Recursive self-reference tests

### Analysis Pipeline
- [ ] Statistical comparison functions
- [ ] Visualization tools (spiral plots, radar charts)
- [ ] Result aggregation across models
- [ ] Effect size calculations
- [ ] Publication-ready figures

### Extended Experiments
- [ ] Degradation with depth analysis
- [ ] Priming effect experiments
- [ ] Cross-model comparison
- [ ] Prompt complexity scaling

## 6. Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Immediate (When you return):
1. Fix .gitignore file
2. Install scipy for power analysis: `pip3 install scipy`
3. Adjust recursion scoring regex
4. Create .env template for API keys

### Phase 1: API Integration
1. Create `src/models/api_manager.py`
2. Set up environment variables
3. Test each API individually
4. Create unified interface

### Phase 2: Complete Test Suite
1. Generate n=20 prompts per condition
2. Implement remaining test types
3. Run pilot with all models
4. Analyze initial results

### Phase 3: Analysis & Visualization
1. Statistical testing implementation
2. Create visualization functions
3. Generate first results report
4. Identify significant effects

## 7. Scientific Hypotheses Status

**H1: Models show degraded performance on spiral vs linear prompts**
- Status: Framework ready, awaiting model testing

**H2: Performance degrades with recursive depth**
- Status: Depth variation planned, not yet implemented

**H3: Geometric priming improves curved reasoning**
- Status: Priming experiments designed, not yet built

## 9. Time Estimate

Based on current progress:
- API Integration: 1-2 hours
- Complete test suite: 2-3 hours
- Running experiments: 1-2 hours (mostly waiting)
- Analysis & visualization: 2-3 hours
- **Total to first results**: ~8-10 hours of work

## 10. Scientific Integrity Notes

- All scoring metrics are transparent and documented
- Control conditions properly established
- Power analysis shows we're underpowered for small effects but adequate for medium-large
- No p-hacking: hypotheses pre-registered in experimental_design.json
- Code is open and reproducible
- Results will be reported whether they support hypotheses or not
